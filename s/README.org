* Stethoscape

Stethoscape automatically arranges all metrics in a graphite database
in a heat-mapped ring on the screeen. It also represents each value as
a spatially positioned sound. You are in the center of the ring,
facing up. Put on your headphones, open another tab, and go. Like a
spider in her web...

- At more than 1,000 metrics total, there's static caused by
  phasing, I guess. Bundle metrics so that you listen to something
  more like a histogram?
- The static is much worse using the HRTF panning model
- Might be worth abstracting the panning nodes: experiment to find a
  good number where the direction can be determined, and map sounds
  onto those.

* Roadmap

- [X] Simulate some metric-like data
  - [X] Common prefixes
  - [X] Statefully adjust random changes

- [X] Make some noise
  - [X] Noise only on changes from the average

- [-] Canvas to draw the ring
  - [X] Use common prefixes to bundle metrics in slices
  - [X] Heatmap color the ring
    - Brightness for magnitude
    - Blue/red shift for direction
  - [ ] Show the metric name

- [ ] Access real data
  - [ ] Graphite config & authentication
    - [ ] Maybe [[https://graphite-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Graphite API]] a python server providing access
  - [ ] Enumerate metrics
  - [ ] Tail changes

* Notes

- Firefox requires =about:config= =privacy.file_unique_origin= set to false
